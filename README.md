## About this Repository

Welcome to the C# Coding Challenges Repository! Here, I tackle various coding challenges in the C# programming language. One unique aspect of this repository is my preference for writing code from scratch, avoiding the use of predefined C# methods for common tasks as possible.

### Coding Philosophy

I believe that understanding the underlying principles of coding is essential for any programmer. While C# provides a rich set of built-in methods and libraries, I choose to implement solutions without relying on them as possible. This approach allows me to dive deep into the problem-solving process, fosters a better understanding of algorithms, and improves my coding skills.

### Code Examples

You'll find that the code within this repository follows this philosophy. Instead of using predefined C# methods for common operations, I strive to implement these operations myself, providing transparency into the code logic and algorithm design.

Feel free to explore the challenges, review the code, and provide feedback. I'm always open to suggestions and improvements.

Happy coding!
